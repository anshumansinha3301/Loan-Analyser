## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+ installed on your system
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zenitsu0509/Loan-Analyser.git
   cd Loan-Analyser
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the web application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser and navigate to:**

   ```url
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

## 💡 Usage

### Web Interface

1. Open the web application in your browser
2. Enter your loan details:
   - **Loan Amount**: The principal amount you want to borrow
   - **Annual Interest Rate**: Interest rate as a percentage (e.g., 6.5 for 6.5%)
   - **Loan Term**: Duration of the loan in years
3. Click "Calculate Loan" or press `Ctrl+Enter`
4. View your results including monthly payment and complete amortization schedule

### Command Line Interface

```python
from loan_analyser import Loan

# Create a loan instance
loan = Loan(principal=250000, annual_rate=0.065, term_years=30)

# Calculate monthly payment
monthly_payment = loan.monthly_payment()
print(f"Monthly Payment: ${monthly_payment:.2f}")

# Get amortization schedule
schedule = loan.amortization_schedule()
print("First 5 payments:")
for payment in schedule[:5]:
    print(payment)

# Calculate total interest
total_interest = loan.total_interest()
print(f"Total Interest: ${total_interest:.2f}")
```

## 🎯 Example Calculations

### Sample Loan: $250,000 at 6.5% for 30 years

- **Monthly Payment**: $1,580.17
- **Total Interest**: $318,861.88
- **Total Amount Paid**: $568,861.88

### Key Insights:

- Early payments are mostly interest
- Principal payments increase over time
- Total interest can be significant over long terms

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Backend (Python/Flask)

- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for serving the application
- **RESTful API**: JSON-based communication between frontend and backend
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive input validation and error responses
- **Mathematical Precision**: Accurate financial calculations with proper rounding

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for modern layouts
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript, enhanced with it
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation with visual feedback
- **AJAX Communication**: Smooth user experience without page reloads

### Algorithms

- **Standard Amortization Formula**: `M = P * [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]`
- **Special Cases**: Handles zero interest rate scenarios
- **Precision**: All calculations rounded to 2 decimal places for currency
